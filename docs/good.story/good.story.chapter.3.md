## Chapter III - Hong Kong Enterprise Surprise (旺角)

### Recap

Lucy dreamt about her confrontation at the desk by her CEO at `INCO`. After not getting a very good sleep, she goes to
the supermarket and by chance finds a long-lost swiss friend of hers called `Ursi Tursi Lursi`.
Lucy then talks to `Lursi`, and tells him the story of a cat that had a special bond with her and that ended up blowing
the whistle on a secret camera that was watching Lucy's every step.

### Hong Kong Enterprise Surprise

Back in The Netherlands and as Lucy was making strides to climb up the corporate ladder with her extraordinary IT skills
and a natural-born ability for business, she hit a goldmine when she was invited to join Red Portal Enterprises BV.
After a long month of intensive `SCRUM` training, something that Lucy already knew and found useless at that point, she
had a meeting with her manager `Toos Boos`. `Toos` called `Lucy` for a meeting:

- Toos Boos - So Lucy please have a seat
- Lucy - Thank you Sir - Lucy takes a seat.
- TB - I hear you had a very good training?
- L - Yes Sir, it was one of the best of my life - says Lucy with a sarcastic tone
- TB - That is great to hear, but I see that it has come to an end right?
- L - Yes, we just finished the last lecture today, which is also why I quite wonder what are the next steps for me, in
  this great company of yours?
- TB - Do you like the far-east Lucy?
- L - I can't say that I do or that I don't Sir. I just haven't been there yet, but what I have seen in books is quite
  amazing.
- TB - Well, I have the first assignment to you. It's in Hong Kong
- L - In Hong Kong? That's... a bit unexpected...hmmm
- TB - Yes, do you have boyfriend or anyone you'd need to see very often?
- L - Sir, I live alone, South of Utrecht, I don't have much of a family anymore.
- TB - So I guess working in Hong Kong wouldn't really bother you. I think you'll enjoy it.
- L - Is this to be in Hong Kong permanently Sir?
- TB - No (giggles), You'll be working there for two weeks and if you like it we could do something like one week in
  The Netherlands and two weeks in Hong Kong, or any way you prefer.
- L - Can I just try for the first month?
- TB - Sure, I'll arrange your trip details, and you don't have to worry about anything. Just remember to get your
  Octopus card to get around in the metro in Hong Kong.
- L - Ok Sir. Thank you for the opportunity.

In Lucy's mind this was actually an amazing opportunity. Finally, some recognition. Finally, the time she was waiting
for.
She would get a decent work. She would travel the world, showing off her professional skills wherever she went.
Boarding a long flight to Hong Kong was also something Lucy didn't do very often, and she really expressed her
concern about travelling so far abroad. What customs should she be aware of? Should she take vaccines? What was
different between Hong Kong and Amsterdam?
The only thing `Red Portal Enterprises BV` manifested was just this idea that Lucy should just relax and board the plane
and commit to her assignment in Hong Kong. And so Lucy did.

Arriving at Hong Kong International Airport was an amazing feeling for Lucy. A part of Lucy felt that she was just going
places. Amazing. An assignment in an international city like Hong Kong. 

Upon arrival, Hong Kong international airport did not seem to be much different from other airports. Lucy simply waited a few minutes to get her luggage in the rotating belt.
As Lucy was passing through customs, two officers noticed that she was walking alone with a big suitcase. Lucy was immediately called to the customs search room for a routine check:

- Officer 1 - What is your name?
- Lucy - My name is Lucy, and I'm here in HK for a business trip.
- O1 - Mss Lucy, please let me be the one asking questions. Can I see your business card please?
- L - You mean my ID card ?
- O1 - That is also necessary.
- L - Ok... this my ID card which you can see it says that I come from The Netherlands, and I don't have a business card.

Officer 1 looks at Officer 2 and both of them begin to stare in suspicion to Lucy and her suitcase:

- Officer 2 - I need to open you suitcase
- L - Got right ahead
- O1 - Mss Lucy, do you have any kind of official documents that corroborate the fact that you are in HK for business ?

Lucy's blood pressure instantly dropped. Lucy didn't print any official documents regarding the trip. Actually Red Portal Enterprises didn't gave her any indication or any official document to use in this circumstance.
It seemed as if customs was very strict and Lucy didn't had enough to back her story. As the officers continued searching in her briefcase, opening bottles and checking the contents of everything she brought, Lucy reminded herself to check her email but first to give a call to Toos Boos.

- Lucy - Sir, I think if I call my manager, he'd be able to explain to you better than I...
- O1 - Sorry to interrupt you Mss Lucy, but whoever you call now, I also need documents to be able to assess the purpose of your visit. However, while we search your briefcase, you may call him if you think that might help you.
- L - Thank you!

As Lucy kept calling Toos Boos, he didn't pick up the phone. He didn't even have a voice mail. As the offices in Amsterdam were closed, Lucy realised that she was alone right now. There was no welcome committee, no calls to check if the trip went well, nothing. And the officers needed to assess Lucy's purpose of her visit:

- Lucy - My manager is not picking up the call, would it be enough if I show you the HR email from my company with all the details and goals of this trip?
- O2 - I'll check with my supervisor. One moment.

It was another tense moment. Lucy had to wait

- Supervisor - Hello Mrs Lucy. I believe you wanted to show me an email?
- Lucy - Yes, here it is. This is the description of the trip and the purpose of it.
- S - Higher Grounds Banking huh? Very nice, I actually know them and I have also seen colleagues of yours coming here through customs.
- L - Really?
- S - Yes, your company is very clumsy and I understand your situation... And you are lucky that I do so.
- L - What do you mean ?
- S - Mrs. Lucy, when people come to Hong Kong, especially in international flights they need to provide a clear justification for their stay and especially if they are travelling alone as you do. Your company didn't tell you this?
- L - Nobody briefed me about this. I've travelled before to other places in the world and I honestly speaking did not expected this and I'm sorry about it.
- S - It's not a problem. You can go. I can see my colleagues just finished inspection your suitcase. I also see your email and I see that you are on an assignment to Higher Grounds Banking via Red Portal Enterprises, but please tell your company that this is being noted and that there may come a point where we will not allow entry under these circumstances.
- L - I will Sir, thank you.
- S - Welcome to Hong Kong and I wish you a pleasant stay and success with your project.
