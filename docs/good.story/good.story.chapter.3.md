## Chapter III - Hong Kong Enterprise Surprise

### Recap

Lucy dreamt about her confrontation at the desk by her CEO at `INCO`. After not getting a very good sleep, she goes to the supermarket and by chance finds a long-lost swiss friend of hers called `Ursi Tursi Lursi`.
Lucy then talks to `Lursi`, and tells him the story of a cat that had a special bond with her and that ended up blowing the whistle on a secret camera that was watching Lucy's every step.

### Hong Kong Enterprise Surprise

Back in The Netherlands and as Lucy was making strides to climb up the corporate ladder with her extraordinary IT skills and a natural-born ability for business, she hit a goldmine when she was invited to join Red Portal Enterprises BV.
After a long month of intensive `SCRUM` training, something that Lucy already knew and found useless at that point, she had a meeting with her manager `Toos Boos`. `Toos` called `Lucy` for a meeting:

- Toos Boos - So Lucy please have a seat
- Lucy - Thank you Sir - Lucy takes a seat.
- TB - I hear you had a very good training?
- L - Yes Sir, it was one of the best of my life - says Lucy with a sarcastic tone
- TB - That is great to hear, but I see that it has come to an end right?
- L - Yes, we just finished the last lecture today, which is also why I quite wonder what are the next steps for me, in this great company of yours?
- TB - Do you like the far-east Lucy?
- L - I can't say that I do or that I don't Sir. I just haven't been there yet, but what I have seen in books is quite amazing.
- TB - Well, I have the first assignment to you. It's in Hong Kong
